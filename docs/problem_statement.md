Problem:
Build a deep learning - based system to classify plant leaf images into healthy or disease categories using transfer learning, with a focus on real-world usability and mobile deployment.

Impact:
Early detection of plant diseases can help farmers take timely action, reduce crop loss, and improve agricultural productivity- espcially in regions with limited access to agronomy experts.
